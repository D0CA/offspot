# DragonBones Fork

So dragon bones is dead. I took some time to take the code from https://github.com/DragonBones/DragonBonesJS and

1. updated it to modern js
2. updated it to pixi 6
3. applied a few pull requests hanging on DragonBonesJS
4. removed shared ticker support as I don't want that ticker dependency
5. changed armature display to use `Container` instead of `Sprite`
6. wtf was even going on in `WorldClock`, refactored it
7. added `stopped` to `IAnimatable` that blocks `advanceTime` calls
8. changed `PixiFactory.buildArmatureDisplay` to allow for creating armatures not bound to a clock
9. made so child armatures are updated on `advanceTime` when clock is not set

now you can `import { PixiFactory } from "@md5crypt/dragonbones-pixi"` like a normal person
